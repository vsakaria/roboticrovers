Although I did not use a TDD framework such as Jasmine, I developed the project with a TDD frame of mind. 

I wrote method calls based on what I expected to happen, I then wrote the code and compared the result to what I expected.

I tried to make all classes use Single responsibility.

The rover class has an array compass which holds N,E,S,W. If R is inputted the array is incremented by 1 and the new direction is given.
Similarly with "L" too.

The Rover is moved based on it direction and the x and y co-ord are incremented.

I wanted to use the jQuery data() function to assign the rover1, rover2 object to a HTML form so I wouldn't have to repeat the input fields and jQuery html() techniques twice. However I wanted to submit the project in a timely fashion.
