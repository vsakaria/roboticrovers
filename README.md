Although I did not use a TDD framework such as Jasmine, I developed the project with a TDD frame of mind. 

I wrote method call based on what I expected to happen, I then wrote the code and compared the answer to what I expected.

All I tried to make all class use Single responsibility.

The rover class has an array compass which holds N,E,S,W. If R is inputted the array is incremented by 1 and the new direction is given.
Similarly with "L" too.

I wanted to use the jQuery data() function to assign the rover1, rover2 object to a HTML form so I wouldn't repeat the input fields and run.js jQuery html() techniques twice. However I wanted to submit the project in a timely fashion.
